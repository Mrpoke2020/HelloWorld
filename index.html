      Hello World

      HTML is the basic code for all websites. It is easy to learn. 
    It can be enhanced with other codes, such as CSS and Javascript.

      The reason I chose this class is to expand my web design skills.
      I already took an online course in middle school, but it only
      covered the basics. I want to learn how to create a user 
      friendly website.
